    <p>The beginning of the beautiful game goes back a long way. All the way to the 1880s when no known teams were really playing
      and it was just people kicking a ball. It is believed to have started between England and Scotland but no body really knows.
      As time went on, the World Cup was introduced in 1930. Uruguay won this one to begin what would be the most anticipated event
      in the world. Players like Pele and Maradona truly changed the game. With their incredible skill and technique that was miles 
      above everybody else. But history is more about who played and who won, but instead how the game was played and how it was done.
