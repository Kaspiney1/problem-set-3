    <p>Soccer currently has its ups and downs. To begin with, Soccer is one of the most popular sports
       in the world. Some of the best players in history are playing right now. With every good thing,
       comes a problem. The organizations that are linked with the sport like FIFA and UEFA can at

       in a competition or favoring a player in a voting process. For this page, we will go more in
       depth on the problems and benefits for the current state of Soccer.
