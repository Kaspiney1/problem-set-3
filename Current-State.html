    <p>Soccer currently has its ups and downs. To begin with, Soccer is one of the most popular sports
       in the world. Some of the best players in history are playing right now. With every good thing,
       comes a problem. The organizations that are linked with the sport like FIFA and UEFA can at
       times become very corrupt. Whether this comes in the form of taking money to favor one team
       in a competition or favoring a player in a voting process. For this page, we will go more in
       depth on the problems and benefits for the current state of Soccer.
     <h2>The Benefits</h2>
     <p>There are a lot of positives when it comes to liking Soccer in todays world. You have a wide variety of teams and leagues or
       tournaments to pay attention to and you can follow which ever one you really want. Whether it is the Champions League, Premier League
       or even the World Cup, you do not really run out of options to choose from. Another benefit Soccer has to offer is its' popularity.
       Since it is so popular, this allows for tickets to games to be a lot cheaper since there would be a lot of people attending these
       games compared to a lot less for a sport like Baseball. Finally, the last benefit would be the amount of games being played.
